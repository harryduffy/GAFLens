## Manager Selection Form

A bespoke Manager Selection Tool built for Global Alternative Funds that guides the investment team through manager due diligence and comparison.

**Problem**
- Manager selection meeting notetaking isn’t standardised → it’s difficult to efficiently compare and recall manager insights
- Notes are siloed → Donna, Pete (D+P) cannot efficiently access each other’s notes/data to bolster their own workflows
- Lack of a centralised system → limited visibility, collaboration and ability to compare managers across key benchmarks
- Overreliance on D+P intuition → the current process leans heavily on D+P’s experience. If GAF were to scale and hire new team members, there’s no structured framework or process in place to guide decision-making or institutionalise manager selection thinking for junior team members

**Feature Set**
- Manager Database: searchable, filterable, groupable, sortable
- Manager Meeting Database: searchable, filterable, groupable, sortable
- Cross-Platform Linking: hyperlink access to Global Alternative Fund's SharePoint, Salesforce and Preqin to support fast cross-platform research
- Manager Selection Form: form to guide manager meetings, to institutionalise/standardise the manager selection process
- GPT-wrapper Summaries: GPT pre-prompting with Global Alternative Funds context to execute a variety of summarisation pieces (to support IC meetings, guide future meetings etc.)

**Potential Add-Ons**
- Manager pipeline visualisation – a kanban-style interface showing managers moving through stages (initial meeting, diligence, shortlist, approved etc.)
- Semantic Analysis – use natural language processing to compare qualitative notes across managers to enhance comparison
- Internal Rating System – let D+P score managers against pre-defined criteria for better comparison etc
